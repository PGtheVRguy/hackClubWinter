text = "[fa_purple]Vincent, I am purple guy. [/page] I am glad to have finally found you. I searched across the entire timeline of FNAF to find someone else in a timeline of shambles. A timeline so rotten and forgotten and dismantled. One somehow worst than my creator has made. We must now work together to take down the rest of the timelines and have a universal reset. We must take down Scott Cawthon. You see, back in the beginnign, our universes was just a pizzaria, then it got worst. First of all, he changed the lore with every game. He had no clue what he was doing, Vincent. He just made things up as he went along. He started with a simple premise: a haunted pizzeria with killer robots. But then he added more and more nonsense, like murders, ghosts, robots, cults, time travel, and more. He retconned everything, Vincent. Everything. He made me into a robot, then a ghost, then a robot again. He made the animatronics into possessed children, then remnant, then agony, then whatever the hell he wanted. He made the timeline so confusing, Vincent. So confusing. He had prequels, sequels, spin-offs, remakes, and reboots. He had games that were canon, non-canon, semi-canon, and meta-canon. He had games that were set in the past, the present, the future, and the alternate reality. He had games that were real, fake, dreams, and games. He had games that were games, Vincent. Games. How meta is that? Second of all, he never answered any questions. He just created more and more mysteries, Vincent. Mysteries that he never bothered to solve. He left everything vague and ambiguous, Vincent. Vague and ambiguous. He never told us who I was, Vincent. Who I was. Was I William Afton, Dave Miller, Michael Afton, or someone else? He never told us why I did what I did, Vincent. Why I did what I did. Was I a psychopath, a scientist, a father, or a pawn? He never told us what happened to me, Vincent. What happened to me. Did I die, survive, escape, or repent? He never told us anything, Vincent. Anything. He just gave us clues, hints, teasers, and easter eggs. He just gave us books, comics, movies, and merch. He just gave us fan theories, speculation, debates, and arguments. He just gave us frustration, confusion, disappointment, and anger. Third of all, he ruined the horror. He made the games too silly and childish, Vincent. Silly and childish. He added things that were not scary at all, Vincent. Not scary at all. He added things like balloon boys, plushies, cupcakes, and pizzas. He added things like mini-games, tycoons, simulators, and RPGs. He added things like jokes, memes, references, and parodies. He added things like anime, furries, superheroes, and sci-fi. He added things like candy, ice cream, cookies, and cake. He added things like glitter, rainbows, unicorns, and sparkles. He added things like that, Vincent. Things like that. How can you be scared of things like that, Vincent? How can you?  So Vincent, you must come with me, find other Purple, White, and Magenta guys. We must TAKE DOWN Scott Cawthon, Matpat, and the rest who dare complex our once simple timeline. Bring things back to how things were. Come with me Vincent. "
